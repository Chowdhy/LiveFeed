This project had me work in a group of software engineers to design and create a cloud application.

The application that we decided to create is "LiveFeed". The purpose of LiveFeed is to enable chefs to share their recipes with their audience, and stream the recipe to their audience in real-time, allowing for a step-by-step follow through.

This project involved setting up a cloud application in Azure, as well as managing Azure services such as blob storage, NoSQL databases, PubSub chat notifications. I was responsible for integrating Google's Live Streaming service into the project, allowing for a user to broadcast their video feed from OBS to the platform and stream in real-time.

We decided to implement this application using a Python backend and a ReactJS frontend.
